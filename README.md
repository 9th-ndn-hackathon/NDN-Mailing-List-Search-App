# NDN-Mailing-List-Search-App
NDN mailing list search application is search tool for NDN mailing lists where NDN researchers can search the question before posting it on the mailing list. For example, if someone is looking for the solution of “AdHoc faces”, then he/she may enter the key word “AdHoc faces” in the search text box, and this application will return a list of all questions related to “AdHoc faces”, which were asked by the others before and answered by the NDN experts. It will save the time of both the person who is asking the question and the one who will answer it.
